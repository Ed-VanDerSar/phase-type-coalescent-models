# Phase-type distributions associated with a nested coalescent

This project aims to apply the properties of the \textit{phase-type} distribution to study certain functionals of multispecies coalescent processes. Specifically, we will study the time to the most recent common ancestor and the number of branches. The aim is to compare the results obtained with those corresponding to a \textit{Kingman in Kingman} process and draw conclusions about the statistical relevance of the model.
