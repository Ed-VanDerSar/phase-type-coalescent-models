# Phase-type distributions associated with a nested coalescent

This project aims to apply the properties of the phase-type distribution to study certain functionals of some relevant coalescent processes. We will study the time to the most recent common ancestor and the number of branches.

## Nested coalescent

The aim is to compare the results obtained with those corresponding to a Kingman-in-Kingman process and draw conclusions about the statistical relevance of the model.

## Coalescents with structured populations

To be added...
